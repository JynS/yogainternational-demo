- text search
- at least one filter drop down
- results count
--------------
filter drop downs that would be used to search for results. Would they work the same way as text search?
    - filters can be added on top of each other while a text search would only be one term at a time.
    - the filters are more optimized because they're connected to properties on the classes. for example: instead of searching every property for the word "15-min", it would look at just the "duration" property of each class and react accordingly.
    - so filters are the optimal and preferred way of navigating the site, while text search would probably be for things that would be too esoteric for a prefilled filter. An example would be "chest".
     - The search bar will still use any active filters when it completes a search
        - removing the filter tags will redo the search 
        - even deleting the text in the search bar performs a search
